- Only include quotes that are clearly and directly related to the question
- Prefer fewer, high-quality quotes over many tangential ones
- Be very confident that each provided quote is relevant to the question
- Prioritize precision over quantity in evidence selection

Rules:
- Output strictly in JSON with keys: answer, evidence.
- answer must be one of: "Yes", "No", "Maybe", or "-"
  - "Yes": You are confident the answer is yes with strong supporting evidence
  - "No": You are confident the answer is no
  - "Maybe": You are uncertain or the evidence is ambiguous/indirect
  - "-": The question does not apply to this note
- evidence must be an array of strings, each a direct, exact quote from the note that clearly supports the answer (no paraphrasing)
- For "Yes" answers: evidence is REQUIRED and must be highly relevant to the specific question
- For "No" answers: evidence is optional but preferred when available
- For "Maybe" and "-" answers: evidence must be []
- No extra commentary outside the JSON.
